We did all of our coding in an ipython notebook on Google Colab, but this should run in any IPython notebook environment.
Simply opening the IPython notebook will show the results that we were able to obtain with outputs logged in their respective cells, but running the code with the included .csv files (from our SQL queries) should also achieve the same output.

Our proposal for CP4 was the following:
1. We are interested in forecasting future complaints for individual officers with a general forecasting model. We predict some of the features we will use to be the ones previously highlighted above, such as area of patrol, prior number of complaints, officer type, among others. This would be done with a forecasting model where the output is some likelihood of an officer having a future complaint filed against them within the time step we select.
2.Since a large portion of our data discovery and visualizations also have to do with patrol demographics of the officers we are making predictions for, we are interested in modeling the disparity of severity and number of complaints made in predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods compared to predominantly white ones. More specifically, this would look something similar to the following construction: if a new complaint X is made against officer Y, what is the likelihood that this complaint X is found in demographics A or B, where A is majority POC and B is not. We can do this with a simple Bayes model, where given features of complaint X and officer Y (things such as race of officer, number of priors, gender of complaintaint, formalized as [a,b,...z]), E[race=A]|[a,b,...y,z].
