Our group tested and ran all our queries using a remote DB configuration with DataGrip, as specified in the previous assignment setting up databases.

To run our queries, simply load the .sql queries (labled by name) in software of choice, and run as per software instructions.

We will outline how we run these in DataGrip.
In DataGrip, every .sql query can be run by selecting console as the session after loading the query and pressing green play button.
If DataGrip gives option to run multiple statements simply press green play button again, and the query should run.

Questions asked in Proposal:
Question 1: What are the most popular categories of complaints when it comes to civilian complaints? What about officer complaints? Are there any similarities to the trends between the two?
Question 2: What is the average years of service for police officers over a certain threshold of complaints? What positions do these officers generally hold i.e. field cop or office cop, high rank or low rank etc.?
Question 3: Which area of patrol has the highest amount of complaints per capita?
Question 4: What is the demographic profile of the districts with the highest number of allegations per capita? We changed this from our original proposal question, though both are concerned with demographic and race breakdowns of the complaint data. The original question of comparing race of officers and areas of patrol for each given area was unanswerable by the tables provided in the database.
